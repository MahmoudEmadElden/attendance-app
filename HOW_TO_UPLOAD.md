# How to Upload Your App to GitHub

Since I cannot log in to your account for security reasons (and GitHub requires 2FA/Tokens instead of passwords now), here is the **easiest way** to get your code online.

## Step 1: Create the Repository
1.  Go to [https://github.com/new](https://github.com/new).
2.  **Repository Name**: Enter `attendance-app` (or any name you like).
3.  **Public/Private**: Choose **Public** (so you can deploy it easily).
4.  Click **Create repository**.

## Step 2: Upload Files
1.  On the next page, look for the link that says: **"uploading an existing file"**.
2.  Click that link.
3.  Open your folder `c:\Users\emade\OneDrive\Desktop\attendance` on your computer.
4.  **Select all files** (Ctrl+A) and **Drag and Drop** them into the GitHub page.
5.  Wait for them to upload.
6.  Click **Commit changes**.

## Step 3: Deploy (Get your Mobile Link)
Now that your code is on GitHub:
1.  Go to [Glitch.com](https://glitch.com).
2.  Click **New Project** -> **Import from GitHub**.
3.  Paste the URL of your new repository (e.g., `https://github.com/MahmoudEmadElden/attendance-app`).
4.  Your app will start! Click **Share** -> **Live App** to get the link for your phone.
