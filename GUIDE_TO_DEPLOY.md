# How to Get Your App Link (Deploy to Glitch)

Since you want a link to access the app from your mobile, the easiest free way is to use **Glitch.com**.

## Steps:

1.  **Go to [Glitch.com](https://glitch.com/)** and sign up/login.
2.  Click **"New Project"** -> **"glitch-hello-node"** (or "Import from GitHub" if you pushed this code, but manual is easy too).
3.  You will see a file editor. You need to copy the files I created into Glitch:
    *   **package.json**: Copy the content of `package.json` from your computer to `package.json` on Glitch.
    *   **server.js**: Create a file named `server.js` (or use existing script) and paste the code.
    *   **public/index.html**: Create folder `public` if needed, then file `index.html` and paste the code.
    *   **public/style.css**: Same for CSS.
    *   **public/script.js**: Same for JS.
4.  **Wait a moment**: Glitch will automatically install the packages (you'll see a loading circle).
5.  Click **"Share"** or **"Preview"** -> **"Open in new window"**.
6.  **Copy the URL** from the address bar. This is your link! Send it to your mobile.

## Excel File
- The `attendance.xlsx` file will be created automatically in the Glitch project when you submit the first attendance.
- You can access the terminal in Glitch (Tools -> Terminal) or use the "Download" link I added at the bottom of the app to get your file.
